3. Product diet dimension 
4. Product Dimension
5. Promotion Dimension
6. Retail Baskets Fact

8. Store Dimension 

## Import the Dataset and Preview
The dataset was available to us with a lot of superfluous information which then had to be imported, cleaned and transformed for the following analysis to take place. 

### Preprocessig
Cleaning the data was required due to the presence of a lot of unwanted information along with the inaccuracy of data placements. Pulling out null values along with transforming the data types were the core procedures.
